		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The inspiration for this pie came from a very unlikely source: soup! After having an incredible savory pumpkin-tahini soup, I became obsessed with this flavor combination. It was all the things: nutty, toasty, creamy, earthy, and just so delicious.</p>
			
			<p>But how would that flavor combo hold up in a dessert? Especially one as classic as pumpkin pie? Would it work? I mean: If pumpkin can dual-wield in both sweet and savory dishes, why can't tahini?</p>
			
			<p>After some trial and error in the kitchen, I discovered that the answer to this is, in fact, a resounding yes! It was all about finding the right amount of tahini vs. pumpkin vs. spice and sweetness in order to not have one ingredient overpower the other. The end result was a pie that was perfectly balanced in both flavor and texture.</p>
			
			<p>And while it's hard to improve on a truly delicious classic like pumpkin pie, this new tahini version sure gives tradition a run for its money. At first glance, the tahini may seem like a strange addition — I mean, it's sesame paste, after all — but when paired with the pumpkin and sweetness of this pie, it provides a whole new level of flavor and complexity that is indescribable.</p>
			
			<p>So, if you're looking for a new and incredible way to make over a very classic dessert, give this Pumpkin Tahini Pie a try. You won't regret it.</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
				<li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
				<li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>

				<li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
				<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
				<li>Place prepared pie crust onto a baking sheet.</li>
				<li>In a bowl, whisk together pumpkin, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, tahini, heavy cream, vanilla, and salt until smooth and combined. Pour into prepared pie crust.</li>
